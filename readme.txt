== Description ==

The AWE plugin is based on a simple idea: read several news feeds, select a few posts, and distribute them into another feed. This plugin gives reliability by making a copy of the news incase the source is shutdown. Furthermore, because posts can be distributed at various sources it makes domain name based censorship noneffective in various network environments. Read hundreds of sources of news at one place for accessibility and improved reading speed across several sources. This is your personal newspaper where you choose what to pay attention to and to make the headlines. Note: This project is experimental and should not be used in production.
